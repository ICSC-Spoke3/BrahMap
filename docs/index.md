# Welcome to BrahMap

<font color="red"> **This project is currently under active development!!!** </font>

`BrahMap` is an optimal map-making solution for LiteBIRD, based on [COSMOMAP2](https://github.com/giuspugl/COSMOMAP2), described in [*Puglisi et al (2018)*](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201832710)

`BrahMap` is written completely in Python. It implements GLS map-making, with PCG, taking into account the block-band diagonal noise correlation matrix. This implementation offers solvers of I, QU, and IQU maps.

Go to the [quick start guide](quick_start.md) for a quick introduction to map-making with `BrahMap`. Refer to the [API reference](api_references.md) for a completer reference to `BrahMap` API.
